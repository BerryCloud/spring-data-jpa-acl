/**
 * Defines a list of permissions for a list of roles for this domain object. All of the users who has at least one role
 * from the provided list will gain all the permissions defined here for all of the entities of this domain class.
 * <p>
 * An empty list in the {@code roles} field means: ANY role.
 * <p>
 * If a domain class is NOT annotated with this annotation then the acl treats it as if it was annotated as
 *
 * <pre>
 * &#64;AclRolePermission(roles={"ROLE_ADMIN"}, value="all")
 * </pre>
 *
 * So a user with ADMIN_ROLE will gain all permissions to all objects. However if you add this annotation to a domain
 * class with any other settings, you have to manually set the privileges for the administrators. (Basically if you use
 * this annotation you override the default behaviour). This annotation can be used multiple times.
 * <p>
 * Another Example:
 *
 * <pre>
 * &#64;AclRolePermission(roles={}, value="all")
 * </pre>
 *
 * It means: users with ANY roles gain all permission to the entities of this domain class. By using these settings you
 * can basically turn off the acl for this domain class. (see also {@link NoAcl})
 * <p>
 * You can define multiple permissions in the {@link #value} field. If the list contains {@code "all"} then it provides
 * all possible permissions. If the list contains any permissions (not empty) it automatically provides {@code "read"}
 * permission too.
